CHANGES to each issue's code from the previous:

Volume 1 #11
------------

o   The tentative official title of this game is BattleTech/2.  The
    main executable has been renamed to BTECH2.EXE.  GAME.C is now MAIN.CPP.
    GAME.RC is now MAIN.RC.

o   Converted to C++.  Hexagons, 'Mechs, Maps, and Targetting are objects
    All source files now have .cpp extensions.

o   Removed the hex grid.  All hexagons on the map are now touching

o   Removed the background hex-highlighting, because since there's no map grid,
    there's no place to draw the hexagon's outline.

o   Maps can now be opened and closed for real.  The program starts out
    with no map.  Select "New" or "Open" to get one.

Volume 1 #10
------------

o   Not mentioned in the article is that the program has been compiled
    with IBM's C Set/2 C/C++ compiler.

o   Single-threaded library is used, since only one thread calls
    the runtime library.

o   Vertex Redirection is used to determine the targeting path.  This
    method is only about 90% effective.

o   Added an error handler for centralized error processing.  Note that
    the handler doesn't detect errors.

o   Most modules, especially HEXES and BITMAP, have been clean up.

o   FILES now opens/saves any files, not just terrain maps.  The map
    read and write functions are in TERRAIN, which calls FILES for the
    actual file I/O.

o   Minimizing the main window now hides the info box

o   Moving and targeting have been combined into Move/Target mode.  Left
    button moves, right button targets.

o   Targetting-specific functions moved to TARGET.

o   The drawing functions in HEXES all take presentation space handles
    as parameters.  In addition, most presentation spaces are opened and
    closed within one message.  The exception is the targeting line.

o   A new function, HexOutline(), outlines a hexagon.  It's used by the
    targeting thread.

o   The 'Mech's current position is shown in the Info Box.

o   Maps are now "opened" and "closed", not "loaded" and "saved".
    However, the close option is disable.

o   Improved performance of source hexagon highlighting on 256-color
    displays.

o   The title bar now shows the name of the current map.

o   Release/Debug version of make files are available.  A composite
    project, with two base projects, is provided.

CORRECTIONS to the printed articles:

Volume 1 #9
-----------

o   The diagrams have not been included.

Volume 1 #8
-----------

o   The listing under the HEXES section should read:

      for (hi.c=iStartC; hi.c<=iEndC; hi.c++)
	for (hi.r=iStartR; hi.r<=iEndR; hi.r+=2)
	  HexFillDraw(hi);

    Note that this is only an approximation of what the code would look like.

Volume 1 #7
-----------

o   The article should be titled "Show me the Way," not "Paint by Numbers"
o   The list of terms was not included
o   The bio line should read:

    Timur Tabi is a digital audio hardware programmer for Editing Machines
    Corp.  He can be reached at 11811 Federalist Way #2; Fairfax, VA 22030
    or on the OS/2 Shareware BBS (Fidonet address 1:109/347)

    Sending mail to my New York address will still reach me, although
    not as quickly.

Volume 1 #6
-----------

o   The article should be titled "The Parlance of Squares,"
    not "Paint by Numbers"
o   The bio line should read:

   Timur Tabi still has the same job as last month, but he can
   now be reached at 11811 Federalist Way #2; Fairfax, VA 22030

Volume 1 #5
-----------

o   Aside from the poorly formatted side-bar on page 48, nothing's wrong.

Volume 1 #4
-----------

o   The article should be titled "You can be the Captain," which is taken
    from "Closer to the Heart", by Rush:

	You can be the captain
	And I will draw the chart
	Sailing into destiny
	Closer to the heart

o   The formatting is a bit screwy, but at least my italics are there.

Volume 1 #3
-----------

o   The article title, "In the Beginning", is not clearly indicated.
